# **The Plant Pathalogy Challenge 2020 data set to classify foliar disease of apples** 
![image](https://github.com/vburlay/fgvc7-2020/raw/master/data/fpls-12-723294-g001.PNG) 
A study of the foliar disease of apples for the purpose to:
1) Accurately classify a given image from testing dataset into different diseased category or a healthy leaf;
2) Accurately distinguish between many diseases, sometimes more than one on a single leaf;
3) Deal with rare classes and novel symptoms;
4) Address depth perceptionâ€”angle, light, shade, physiological age of the leaf;
5) Incorporate expert knowledge in identification, annotation, quantification, and guiding computer vision to search for relevant features during learning.

## General Information
> In this project, a major goal was to create a current model. This current model should help with
> diagnosis of the many diseases impacting apples.
> Data set "Plant Pathology" comes from Kaggle [_here_](https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-pathology-2020-fgvc7).

## Setup
You can install the package as follows:
```r
ifrom keras._tf_keras.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from dataclasses import dataclass
from keras._tf_keras.keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input
import os
import tensorflow as tf
import keras._tf_keras.keras
from keras import layers
from keras._tf_keras.keras.layers import Layer
from keras._tf_keras.keras.applications.vgg16 import VGG16
from keras._tf_keras.keras.applications.efficientnet import EfficientNetB0
from keras._tf_keras.keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Usage
The result 0.94025 - 94 % is good but with preprocessing by clustering the accuracy can be improved. Clustering (K-Means) can be an efficient approach for dimensionality reduction but for this a pipeline has to be created that divides the training data into clusters 34 and replaces the data by their distances to this cluster 34 to apply a logistic regression model afterwards:
```r
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ("kmeans", KMeans(n_clusters = d)),
    ("log_reg", LogisticRegression(multi_class = 'ovr',
             class_weight = None, 
             solver= 'saga', 
             max_iter = 10000)),
])
```


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement

- The data implemented in the analysis has a relatively small volume. This should be improved by the new measurements of the characteristics.
- It is also conceivable that the further number of new customer groups will be included in the analysis. In this way, the new characteristics of customers can make the results more meaningful.
